/* I've done some research on how to "read csv" files in cpp.
With my background coming from Python,
it seems like there should be a easy to use package that
can handle various formats and datatypes.
(I also had to learn what a package manager equivalent of writing c/cxx code is)

My conclusion for now is, there are libraries 
that facilitate reading the file and handling the strings,
but I am on my own to write a data structure and methods of parsing.
